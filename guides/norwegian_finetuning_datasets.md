# Norwegian Finetuning Datasets
This is a description of some openly available finetuning datasets that might be useful for evaluating Norwegian NLP Models. The list is focused on training sets that are suitable for testing the performance of transformer-based NLP-models. These set are most likely not suited for making a production system.

## The Talk of Norway: A Richly Annotated Corpus of the Norwegian Parliament, 1998–2016
Every speech is richly annotated with metadata harvested from different sources, and augmented with language type, sentence, token, lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological feature annotations. The work is thoroughly described in this [article](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/71356/ton.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y). From this set a large number of finetuning datasets can be generated.
