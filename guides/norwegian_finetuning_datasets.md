# Norwegian Finetuning Datasets
This is a description of some openly available finetuning datasets that might be useful for evaluating Norwegian NLP Models. The list is focused on training sets that are suitable for testing the performance of transformer-based NLP-models. These set are most likely not suited for making a production system.

## The Talk of Norway: A Richly Annotated Corpus of the Norwegian Parliament, 1998–2016
Every speech is richly annotated with metadata harvested from different sources, and augmented with language type, sentence, token, lemma, part-of-speech, and morphological feature annotations. The work is thoroughly described in this [article](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/71356/ton.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y). From this set a large number of finetuning datasets can be generated.

### Nynorsk/Bokmål

# Named Entity Recognition
This dataset is described in the paper NorNE: Annotating Named Entities for Norwegian by Fredrik Jørgensen, Tobias Aasmoe, Anne-Stine Ruud Husevåg, Lilja Øvrelid, and Erik Velldal, accepted for LREC 2020 and available as pre-print [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12146). NorNE ads named entity annotations on top of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank and was created as a collaboration between Schibsted Media Group, Språkbanken at the National Library of Norway and the Language Technology Group at the University of Oslo. The NorNE corpus is published under the same license as the Norwegian Dependency Treebank.

The dataset is available directly as a [Huggingface Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/norwegian_ner).
